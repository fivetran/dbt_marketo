      Each record is what a Marketo lead looked like on each day. The columns in this model are specified with the `lead_history_columns` variable.

      The start date is configured by the `marketo__first_date` variable, which by default, for dbt Core™ users, is the date of the earliest lead record.
      For Fivetran Quickstart Data Model users, `marketo__first_date` is 18 months in the past. There is currently no way to adjust this within the Quickstart environment,
      though incremental model runs will slowly look further and further in the past. However, please be aware that a full refresh will reset the clock and limit data to 18 months prior.
